# Monai Notebook

Custom notebook based on RHODS standard data science notebook, adding:

* CUDA, which is a requirement for Monai.

* [PyTorch]() ([Github repo]())

* [OpenCV]() ([Github repo]())

* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) ([Github repo](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit))

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required.
See [details on Streamlit implementation](../streamlit-notebook/README.md).
